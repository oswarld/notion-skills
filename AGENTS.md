# AGENTS.md — Instructions for AI Agents

This file contains instructions for AI agents working with this repository.

## Configuring the sync

Configuration is **environment variables only** — `.env` for local runs, repo
variables + secrets for the scheduled workflow. There is no config file to
create. A leftover `config.json` is no longer read at all: the sync only
*detects* one, and fails with the variable name that replaced each key it still
sets so an old deployment can't silently run on ignored settings.

Follow this flow to configure a fresh deployment.

> **Communicating with users:** When showing the user what you've created or configured,
> always display **URLs** (e.g., `https://notion.so/workspace/abc123` or
> `https://github.com/my-org/my-skills`) rather than raw IDs. URLs are easier for users
> to recognize, click, and verify. The settings themselves use IDs internally.

### Step 1: Ensure Notion API access is available

First, ensure that the `ntn` CLI is authenticated for the intended Notion
environment with its **user-owned personal access token** (reported by
`/v1/users/me` as a bot whose owner type is `user`, not `workspace`). The setup
flow uses the standard Notion Public API through `ntn` to:
- Create typed databases (if the user doesn't have one)
- Resolve database IDs to data source IDs
- Query and update skills

If `ntn` is not installed, install or invoke it as described below. A Notion MCP
connection is not required for this flow.

### Step 2: Create or use an existing skills database

> **Installing the `ntn` CLI:** If you need to use the `ntn` CLI and it's not already
> installed, run:
> ```bash
> curl -fsSL https://ntn.dev | bash
> ```
> This installs `ntn` to `/usr/local/bin`. Alternatively, use `npx --yes ntn <command>`
> to run it without a permanent install.

**Default: Create a new skills database** (recommended for new setups)

Use the standard Notion API's `POST /v1/databases` endpoint with
`database_type: skills` to create a typed skills database. Do not use
`/v1/tools/run`: it is reserved for Notion MCP in production.

```json
{
  "parent": { "type": "page_id", "page_id": "<parent-page-id>" },
  "database_type": "skills",
  "title": [{ "type": "text", "text": { "content": "Skills" } }]
}
```

This creates a database with the official Notion Skills schema (`Skill name`,
`Description`, `Files`, `Tags`, `Created by`).

The typed schema is all the sync needs — it reads skills through Notion's Skills
Public API, which projects that schema directly. **Do not add `Published` or
`Plugins` properties**: the API has no per-row publish flag (access to the Notion
connection is what controls publishing) and reports plugin grouping itself, so
neither property would be read.

Use the built-in **"Files"** property for skills that ship more than a `SKILL.md`.
Attachments are delivered alongside the rendered `SKILL.md`; attach a single `.zip`
when you need nested folders (scripts, references) and it is expanded in place on
sync. The `SKILL.md` always comes from Notion.

After creating the database, set its permissions to **"Everyone in workspace can view"**
so team members can browse available skills. You can adjust this in the database's
share settings in Notion.

The response includes the data source in its `data_sources` array — save its ID as
`SKILLS_DATA_SOURCE_ID`.

**Alternative: Use an existing database**

If the user already has a skills database, ask them for the **database ID** (not the
data source ID). You can find it in the Notion URL, e.g.:
`https://notion.so/workspace/<database-id>?v=...`

Then use the `ntn` CLI to resolve it to a data source ID:

```bash
npx --yes ntn datasources resolve <database-id> --env dev --json
```

This returns the data source IDs for that database. Use the appropriate one as
`SKILLS_DATA_SOURCE_ID`.

### Step 3: Add sample skills

To help users get started, create a few sample skills in the database. Focus on
general knowledge work skills rather than coding-specific ones:

**Example skills to create:**

1. **"Meeting Notes"** — "Helps structure and summarize meeting notes, capturing
   key decisions, action items, and follow-ups."

2. **"Document Review"** — "Reviews documents for clarity, completeness, and
   consistency. Suggests improvements and flags potential issues."

3. **"Research Summary"** — "Synthesizes research from multiple sources into
   clear, actionable summaries with key takeaways."

4. **"Email Drafting"** — "Helps compose professional emails with appropriate
   tone, structure, and call-to-action."

5. **"Project Planning"** — "Breaks down projects into phases, milestones, and
   tasks. Identifies dependencies and potential risks."

For each skill, fill in the `Skill name`, `Description`, and skill body content.
Every skill the sync's Notion connection can read is published — there's no
per-row checkbox. Each skills plugin in the workspace becomes its own directory
under `plugins/`, named after the plugin (so a skill in the "Finance" plugin
lands in `plugins/finance/skills/<skill>/`).

### Step 4: Choose or create a target GitHub repository

The sync tool publishes skills to a GitHub repository. You have two options:

**Option A: Create a new GitHub repository** (recommended for new setups)

Use the GitHub CLI to create a new repository that will serve as your skills
marketplace:

```bash
gh repo create <owner>/<repo-name> --private --description "Skills marketplace synced from Notion"
```

For example:
```bash
gh repo create my-org/notion-skills --private --description "Skills marketplace synced from Notion"
```

This creates a fresh private repo ready to receive synced skills. Initialize it
with an empty commit so the sync has a base to build on:

```bash
cd <local-clone-path>
git clone https://github.com/<owner>/<repo-name>.git .
git commit --allow-empty -m "Initial commit"
git push origin main
```

Use the resulting `owner/repo` (e.g., `my-org/notion-skills`) as `GITHUB_REPO`.

**Option B: Use an existing GitHub repository**

If you already have a repository you want to sync skills into, simply use its
`owner/repo` identifier. Make sure you have push access to the repository.

For example, if your repo URL is `https://github.com/my-org/my-skills`, then
`GITHUB_REPO=my-org/my-skills`.

### Step 5: Write the settings to `.env`

```bash
cat >> .env <<'EOF'
NOTION_API_TOKEN=<a Notion token with read access to the skills>
NOTION_ENV=prod
GITHUB_REPO=<from step 4>
GITHUB_BRANCH=main
SKILLS_DATA_SOURCE_ID=<from step 2>
EOF
```

Required: `NOTION_API_TOKEN` and `GITHUB_REPO`. Everything else has a default —
see [`.env.example`](./.env.example) for the full list. The data source id is
not used to read skills; it's recorded in each plugin's marker as the
back-reference into Notion.

For the scheduled workflow, the same settings go on the repo the workflow runs
in — non-secrets as **variables**, tokens as **secrets**:

```bash
REPO=<owner>/<sync-script-repo>
gh variable set SKILLS_GITHUB_REPO --repo "$REPO" --body "<owner>/<skills-repo>"
gh variable set NOTION_ENV --repo "$REPO" --body prod
gh secret set NOTION_API_TOKEN --repo "$REPO"
gh secret set GH_PUSH_TOKEN --repo "$REPO"
```

`GITHUB_REPO` and `GITHUB_BRANCH` are stored as `SKILLS_GITHUB_*` because GitHub
refuses variable names starting with `GITHUB_`; the workflow maps them back.

### Step 6: Confirm the skills are visible to the API

The sync reads `GET /v1/ai/plugins` with `NOTION_API_TOKEN` and
`Notion-Version: 2026-03-11`. Two things
determine what comes back:

- The database must be a **typed** skills DB (`database_type: skills`). Convert
  an older one in-product via "Turn into → Skills DB"; an untyped DB reports zero
  skills.
- The Notion connection must have **read access** to the skills. That access *is*
  the publishing control — there is no `Published` checkbox.

Check it directly:

```bash
NOTION_API_TOKEN=<token> bun run dry-run
```

A `403 restricted_resource` means the token lacks the **Read content** capability.
If expected plugins are missing, check that the connection can read the intended
Skills databases. Each Tags value becomes a plugin; an untagged skill becomes
its own plugin. A plugin archive contains at most 100 skills, with the most
recently updated skills included when there are more.

Follow all list pages before pruning missing plugins. Failed or incomplete
listings must never delete existing plugin directories.

## Common Operations
